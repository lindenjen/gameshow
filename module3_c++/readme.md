## Overview

**Project Title**: Are you smarter than a 5th grader?

**Project Description**: The program runs a game of 'Are you smarter than a 5th grader?' where the user selects a subject and answers increasingly difficult questions.

**Project Goals**: The goal of this program is for the user to get all the questions correct and prove that they are smarter than a 5th grader.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. The first step to building this program is to learn how loops, variables and if statements work in C++.
2. The second step to building this program is to take the knowledge that I've learnt about C++ and write functions, classes, and loops that allow me to create a menu for the user to play the game.
3. The last step to building this program is testing it for any bugs and correcting any possible syntax errors.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the program, gameshow.cpp, in a terminal or IDE
2. Within the terminal, choose the subject by entering the corresponding number
3. Answer the question

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I would like to add a bigger pool of questions and have the program randomly select one each time.
* [ ] I would like to make the answers be multiple choice rather than short answer.
