## Overview

**Project Title**: Kotlin Password Manager

**Project Description**: My program will allow users to save and update their passwords in an easily accessible format. Saving passwords allows users to use more complex passwords, which brings increased cybersecurity from various threats.

**Project Goals**: The goals of my program is to allow users to create passwords, edit their existing passwords, view what passwords they have saved, list an individual password and delete a password.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. The first step to building this program is to learn how loops, variables and if statements work in Kotlin. This program in particular uses a lot of loops and variables which I need to learn the appropriate syntax in order to do.
2. The second step to building this program is to take the knowledge that I've learnt about Kotlin and write functions, classes, and loops that allow me to create a menu for the user and allows the user to create, edit and delete their password.
3. The last step to building this program is testing it for any bugs and correcting any possible syntax errors.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the program, PasswordManager in an IDE 
2. Within the terminal, choose option 1-6 in order to create, edit, view, or delete your passwords
3. Press 6 or ctrl+c to exit the program

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] One feature that I plan on adding to the project is encrypting the passwords, I wanted to do this but ran out of time
* [ ] Another feature that I want to add is the program generating the password for you
* [ ]
