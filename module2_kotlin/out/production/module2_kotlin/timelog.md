| 10/7/2024  | 2:00 pm    |   MTG    | I worked with my team in order to set the goals we wanted to meet during sprint 2 and decided on the individual module project I wanted to complete myself.                                                                                                                             |  60 minutes   |
| 10/9/2024  | 2:00 pm    |    TP    | I worked with my team to create classes that would be required for the app and separate them into different Github files. Then I picked one to start and started to work on filling it out.                                                                                             |  60 minutes   |
| 10/9/2024  | 7:00 pm    |    TP    | I met with my team after class to continue working on the different classes and make sure everyone was getting Github to work with their IDE's and made sure everyone understood the different classes.                                                                                 |  60 minutes   |
| 10/11/2024 | 12:30 pm   |    IM    | I started to learn Kotlin using the Code Academy lessons. I learnt how to declare and set variables, how to print, and how to make a simple conditional statement.                                                                                                                      |  90 minutes   |
| 10/11/2024 | 2:00 pm    |   MTG    | I attended class and discussed how my progress was coming with my team members on all of our individual projects and reflected on how much more I needed to do over the weekend and the following week.                                                                                 |  60 minutes   |
| 10/12/2024 | 5:00 pm    |    IM    | I set up my folder on my IDE to start creating my Kotlin files. I filled out the README and then proceeded to create the different files I would need for the project and set some bare main and empty class functions.                                                                 |  90 minutes   |
| 10/13/2024 | 6:00 pm    |    IM    | I continued my lessons on Code Academy, this time learning how arithmetic with variables works and how to create constructers and accept user input through the terminal.                                                                                                               |  60 minutes   |
| 10/14/2024 | 2:00 pm    |    TP    | My group and I discussed the different classes in Github and wrote in Discord any dependencies that different classes were missing so that it could be fixed before our presentation.                                                                                                   |  60 minutes   |
| 10/14/2024 | 4:00 pm    |    TP    | I worked on fully finishing my class and pushing the new changes to Github, I made sure that my class had all the listeners that the other classes need to interact with my own class.                                                                                                  |  60 minutes   |
| 10/15/2024 | 6:30 pm    |    IM    | I created the main menu loop that will display the program options to users in the terminal. I also created the first create function, which allowed users to create a password, name it was for, and any description they wanted to include.                                           |  90 minutes   |
| 10/16/2024 | 2:00 pm    |   MTG    | I presented with my team to report to the teacher the progress we made as a team during Sprint 2 and to report on our goals for the next sprint.                                                                                                                                        |  60 minutes   |
| 10/17/2024 | 7:00 pm    |    IM    | I added more options to the menu, to allow users to view all the names of passwords they have created and to input a specific password name to view the actual password. I then created functions that allow the user to edit their existing passwords and to view a specific password. |  90 minutes   |
| 10/18/2024 | 2:00 pm    |   MTG    | Brother Godderidge was out of class so instead of showing my program to my team I showed it to my roommate, I let her create a password and then edit it just to demonstrate it working.                                                                                                |  60 minutes   |
| 10/18/2024 | 8:00 pm    |    IM    | I finished making all of the menu operations functional, such as listing all the password names that have been created and deleting passwords, then I worked on trying to get the passwords to save to your local machine so the passwords would reload.                                |  90 minutes   |
| 10/19/2024 | 5:00 pm    |    IM    | I finished making the save to a local machine operational and then I fixed any syntax warnings that were appearing in my environment. Then I made sure to leave good comments throughout my program to make it clear what the program was doing.                                        |  90 minutes   |
